* Fitting a model to obtain g
** Problem Statement

In class, we computed the value of the gravitational constant \( g \)
using the following table of observations and the well-known kinematic
formula:

\[
x = \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]

| Distance [m] | Time [s] |
|--------------+----------|
|         1.86 |        1 |
|         7.42 |        2 |
|        16.70 |        3 |
|        29.68 |        4 |

** Tasks

1. Create a linear model using R's =lm= function to predict the
   falling distance at =time = 5= seconds.
2. Test the prediction against the exact theoretical value for =g= at that time.
3. Plot the model using a scatterplot with a fitted line.
   - Provide solutions using both =ggplot2= and Base R plotting.

*Tip:* The coefficients for the linear model (intercept and slope) are
stored in a vector =coef= (try calling it as a function on your model.

** Expected Output

- A computed prediction for distance at =t = 5s=.

- A comparison between the predicted and theoretical distance values.

- A scatterplot with a regression line visualizing the model fit.

- Submit your results in the form of a notebook, for example an
  Org-mode file, an RStudio notebook, or a straight Jupyter notebook.

- If you worked in an online notebook (other than Emacs, e.g. DataLab,
  Google Colab etc.) , submit the URL and make sure that I can access
  the file (don't make me have to ask you, please).

** Solution
*** Understanding the problem

- Read the full exercise first. I notice that the formula connects the
  quantities time (t), distance (x), and gravitational constant (g) in
  an exact way so that you can always compute one if the other two are
  known.

- Computing g using the formula for a given (x,t) is called the
  "theoretical value" (since we don't need to do any experiments).

- To compute g for a certain value of t = 5 (or any other value), I
  need to predict the distance x, and I can then compute g from these
  two values.

- If this coincides with reality or not depends on the nature of the
  underlying problem - the two values x and t have to grow linearly,
  at a constant rate of change. I notice that this is not given here
  (there's a quadratic dependency of t in the equation), compared to
  e.g. F = ma: when the acceleration a doubles, the force F also
  doubles. The two quantities F and a are directly proportional.

- For non-linear relationships (like x and t in the presence of a
  gravitational force), the linear relationship might be reasonable to
  assume for small changes of t. This is a linear approximation -
  higher order terms are dropped.

- Note that 1/2 * g * t^2 is non-linear in t but linear in t^2.

- But for now, since we're asked to create a linear model, let's do
  that.

*** Checking the documentation for linear models

- The first task is to create a linear model using R's built-in =lm=
  function. I'm going to check the help page for that function first,
  since I haven't used it much lately.

- A quick check shows the arguments that =lm= expects:
  #+begin_src R
    args(lm)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : function (formula, data, subset, weights, na.action, method = "qr",
  :     model = TRUE, x = FALSE, y = FALSE, qr = TRUE, singular.ok = TRUE,
  :     contrasts = NULL, offset, ...)
  : NULL

- I recognize  first two arguments at least, =formula= is something
  like =f(x) ~ x=, where f(x) = b + ax, and the model computes a (the
  intercept at x = 0) and b (the slope).

- The parameter =data= is a data frame. Though in the example in class
  (with =Nile=) we did not use this parameter, but we used it for the
  trendline computation of =mtcars=. I'll leave it out for now since
  there are only two vectors.

- Also, looking for the term =predict=, I notice in "See Also" in the
  =help(lm)= page that there is a method =predict.lm= for linear model
  fits. Perhaps I'll check that in detail later.

*** Solving the problem for a different data set

- An example from class is computing a trendline for the built-in
  dataset =mtcars= (consisting of features for a bunch of cars). We
  always used two features that are likely to be correlated, gas
  mileage (=mpg=) and weight (=wt=) to compute f(x) = =mpg(weight)= for
  unknown points x = =weight=:
  #+begin_src R
    lm(mpg ~ wt, data=mtcars) # lm(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$wt)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  :
  : Call:
  : lm(formula = mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
  :
  : Coefficients:
  : (Intercept)           wt
  :      37.285       -5.344

- The intercept (at zero weight) is 37.285, and the slope of the
  straight line is -5.344 (since it's negative, the line goes from the
  upper left to the lower right - like the distribution of the
  points):
  #+begin_src R :file ../img/mtcars0.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
    plot(mtcars$wt,mtcars$mpg) # plot miles-per-gallon against weight
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:../img/mtcars0.png]]

- How can I get access to the coefficients as such? The exercise says
  that they're stored in a vector =Coef=. Since the model is an R
  object, I'll save it and check its structure.
  #+begin_src R
    mtcars_lm <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data=mtcars)
    str(mtcars_lm)

  #+end_example

- Wow...that's more information than I bargained for! I can see the
  =coefficients= right at the top. The data structure of the model looks
  like a list - let's verify that:
  #+begin_src R
    class(mtcars_lm)
    is.list(mtcars_lm)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : [1] "lm"
  : [1] TRUE

- It is not just a list, it's its own data structure (like =data.frame=)
  but underneath it's a list alright. So I could get the coefficients
  out using =list= extraction techniques:
  #+begin_src R
    a <- mtcars_lm[[1]][1] # Intercept
    a
    b <- mtcars_lm[[1]][2] # slope
    b
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : (Intercept)
  :    37.28513
  :        wt
  : -5.344472

- And now I can compute the =mpg= for a weight =wt= beyond the maximum,
  for example:
  #+begin_src R
    x <- max(mtcars$wt) + 1
    x
    y <- b + a * x
    y
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : [1] 6.424
  : (Intercept)
  :    2.952241

- There is no "theoretical" value here, since we don't have a car of
  that weight with a given mileage. Another exercise: predict the
  mileage for one of the existing cars (with known weight):
  #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both
    mtcars[rownames(mtcars)=="Volvo 142E",c("mpg","wt")] -> volvo
    volvo
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  :             mpg   wt
  : Volvo 142E 21.4 2.78

- What is the predicted mileage for the Volvo?
  #+attr_html: :width 400px:
  [[../img/volvo.png]]

  #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both
    coef(mtcars_lm)[2] -> a # slope
    coef(mtcars_lm)[1] -> b # intercept
    b + volvo[2] * a -> volvo_mpg_pred # volvo[2] is the predictor
    names(volvo_mpg_pred) <- NULL
    paste("Difference predict vs actual:",
          as.numeric(format(abs(volvo_mpg_pred-volvo[1]),digits=3)),
          "[thousand pounds]")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : [1] "Difference predict vs actual:  [thousand pounds]"

- We can still make the plot, show the fit and plot the predicted
  value:
  1) plot the dataset (=plot= with the two variables)
  2) add the trendline (=abline= from our model)
  3) draw the predicted point (=points=)
  #+begin_src R :file ../img/mtcars.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
    plot(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$wt)
    abline(mtcars_lm)
    par(new=TRUE)
    points(x,y,col="red",pch=16)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:../img/mtcars.png]]

- Alas, the first graph is based on the existing dataset and does not
  change when we plot the point, so we need to account for that:
  #+begin_src R :file ../img/mtcars2.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
    plot(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$wt,
         ylim=c(0,max(mtcars$mpg)),
         xlim=c(0,x))
    abline(mtcars_lm)
    par(new=TRUE)
    points(x,y,col="red",pch=16)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:../img/mtcars2.png]]

*** Solving the problem for the given data set

- After running through the example, I have fully grasped the
  mechanics of the exercise. I am now turning to the given data.

- You remember from class that the data are [[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/marsfact.html][Mars data]] (cp. NASA).

- In class, we dealt with this dataset, and we also fitted a linear
  model to a similar data set, the time-series =Nile=. I notice that the
  table of distance x vs. time t is also a time series, and I know how
  to make one (with the =ts= function). Perhaps then I can reuse that
  code.

- For now though, I treat the dataset as a table of two vectors d
  (distance) and t (time):
  #+begin_src R
    d <- c(1.86,7.42,16.70,29.68)
    t <- 1:4
  #+end_src

- These are just like =mpg= and =wt= in the last example: distance changes
  as a function of time, d = f(t).

- I build my linear model accordingly to predict =d= from =t=:
  #+begin_src R
    d_lm <- lm(d ~ t)  # compute d(t) for ALL values of t
    d_lm
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  :
  : Call:
  : lm(formula = d ~ t)
  :
  : Coefficients:
  : (Intercept)            t
  :      -9.270        9.274

- I can now compute =d= for =t= = 5 using the coefficients =a= and =b= which I
  get from the model:
  #+begin_src R
    a <- d_lm[[1]][1]
    a
    b <- d_lm[[1]][2]
    b
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : (Intercept)
  :       -9.27
  :     t
  : 9.274

- There is a function =coef= that extracts the coefficients without
  having to use =list= extraction:
  #+begin_src R
    coef(d_lm)
    coef(d_lm)[1]
    coef(d_lm)[2]
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : (Intercept)           t
  :      -9.270       9.274
  : (Intercept)
  :       -9.27
  :     t
  : 9.274

- And the distance =d = a + bt= is:
  #+begin_src R
    x <- 5  # better: call this `time`
    y <- a + b * x  # call this `distance`
    y
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : (Intercept)
  :        37.1

- In this case, because we know the theoretical value of g at t=5, we
  can compare the prediction and the actual:
  #+begin_src R
    d_actual <- 0.5 * 3.73 * 25 # gt^2/2 where g on Mars = 3.73
    paste("Predicted: ",y, "vs. actual: ",d_actual)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : [1] "Predicted:  37.1 vs. actual:  46.625"

- The simpler plot first to show if and how the model fits the
  existing data points:
  #+begin_src R :file ../img/mars.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
    plot(d ~ t)  # plot observations
    abline(d_lm)  # add trendline (regression line)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:../img/mars.png]]

- Now we do the same thing as before namely extend the range to
  accommodate the computed value, and add the exact value:
  #+begin_src R :file ../img/mars2.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
    plot(d ~ t,
         ylim=c(0,50),  # worst practice! don't depend on the data
         xlim=c(0,x))
    abline(d_lm)
    par(new=TRUE)
    points(x,y,col="red",pch=16)
    points(5,d_actual,col="blue",pch=16)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:../img/mars2.png]]

- As expected after our preliminary thoughts, this is
  miserable. Let's see what we can do about it.

*** Improvements

- The formula for x(t) is non-linear in t but linear in t^2. This
means that we could try to improve our model by transformation.

- Working with data frames is actually more convenient because you
might want to add additional features, like now. Let's start over:

1. Create a =data.frame= =df= with the observations for =x= and t:

   #+begin_src R
     rm(list=ls())
     df <- data.frame("x"=c(1.86,7.42,16.70,29.68))
     df
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   :       x
   : 1  1.86
   : 2  7.42
   : 3 16.70
   : 4 29.68

2. Add the new independent variable, t^2 = =t2=:
   #+begin_src R
     as.numeric(rownames(df)) -> t
     t * t -> t2  # new column values
     df <- data.frame(df,t2)
     df
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   :       x t2
   : 1  1.86  1
   : 2  7.42  4
   : 3 16.70  9
   : 4 29.68 16

3. Build the linear model for (x,t2):
   #+begin_src R
     model <- lm(x ~ t2,data=df)
     model
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   :
   : Call:
   : lm(formula = x ~ t2, data = df)
   :
   : Coefficients:
   : (Intercept)           t2
   :    0.003953     1.854806

4. Now, for t = 5: predicted =x_pred= (using t squared!)
   #+begin_src R
     coef(model)[1] -> b # intercept
     coef(model)[2] -> a # slope
     t <- 5
     x_pred <- b + a * t * t  # linear approximation at t
     x_pred
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : (Intercept)
   :    46.37411

5. Actual for t = 5 with g = 3.73, and difference
   #+begin_src R
     g <- 3.73 # constant on Mars
     x_act <- 0.5 * g * t * t  # actual distance on Mars
     paste("Difference predicted to actual: ",
           as.numeric(format(abs(x_act-x_pred),digits=3)),
           "meters.")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] "Difference predicted to actual:  0.251 meters."

6. Plot the data and the model with predicted values:
   #+begin_src R :file marsNew.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
     plot(df$x ~ df$t2,
          xlab="time squared [s^2]", # x label
          ylab="falling distance [m]",   # y label
          ylim=c(0,50),xlim=c(0,30))   # new limits
     abline(model)  # draw the trendline
     points(x=t*t,y=x_pred,pch=16,col="red")  # set the point
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:marsNew.png]]

7. You can do all of this quite a bit faster by using the =predict=
   function:
   #+begin_src R :results output
     ## Given data
     Time <- 1:4
     Distance <- c(1.86, 7.42, 16.70, 29.68)

     ## Fit linear model - I() inhibits formula interpretation
     model <- lm(Distance ~ I(Time^2))

     ## Predict distance at t = 5 seconds
     predicted_distance <- predict(model, data.frame(Time = 5))

     ## Compute theoretical value
     exact_distance <- 0.5 * 3.73 * (5^2)

     ## Print results
     paste("Difference predicted to actual: ",
           as.numeric(
             format(abs(exact_distance-predicted_distance),digits=3)),
           "meters.")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] "Difference predicted to actual:  0.251 meters."
