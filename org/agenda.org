   2. Microservice technologies
   3. Networking and Internet protocols
   4. Cisco Packet Tracer simulation
   5. Socket programming with C
   #+end_quote

2. What is "Termux"?
   #+begin_quote

   #+end_quote

3. Why is Linux relevant for computer networks?
   #+begin_quote
   1. Dominant operating system for servers (97% of web servers, 90%
      of cloud computing servers, > 70% of global market overall).

   #+end_quote
5. Can you change the MAC address of a device?
   #+begin_quote
   In the simulation tool yes, in reality no - the MAC address is
   composed of two permanent parts: For the producer and the product.
   #+end_quote

6. Sketch the steps of our last lab exercise!
   #+begin_quote
   1) Open Cisco Packet Tracer app on the PC
   2) Login with Cisco net academy using your Google account
   3) Create a simple 2-host network (PC and server)

** DONE DataCamp review: CLoud Computing - Deployment

1. Why is "cloud deployment" an issue and what is it?
   #+begin_quote
   The cloud computing environment can be hacked into.

   Deployment means choosing between a private, a public or a hybrid
   cloud. 
   #+end_quote

2. How is Lyon's cloud computing environment deployed?
   #+begin_quote
   The infrastructure is hybrid:
   - Sensitive data (students, grades, personnel) are private
   - Some services are open to the public (Remote Desktop Service)
   #+end_quote

3. What's "cloud bursting"?
   #+begin_quote
   The private cloud is over capacity and resources are temporarily
   moved to the public cloud.
   #+end_quote
   
4. What's the GDPR? What does it say?
   #+begin_quote
   General Data Protection Regulation in countries of the European
   Union. A major pain in the butt for corporations. Very expensive.

   - Users must give explicit consent to data collection
   - Users must be notified of data breaches
   - Personal information must be anonymized and encrypted
   - Personal data cannot leave EU borders unless protected
   - Violations incur fine of up to 4% of worldwide annual revenue

   In the case of Amazon, that's $22 bn of $574 bn total, or $3 bn of
   the revenue of AWS ($90 bn).
   #+end_quote

5. What are considered "personal data"? Why are they protected?
   #+begin_quote
   - Home address
   - First and last name
   - Email address
   - Location data
   - IP address
   - Racial or ethnic origin
   - Political opinions
   - Sexual orientation
   - Health-related data

   Personal data can identify a person leading to potential identity
   theft with regard to any or all of the categories above.
   #+end_quote
   

** TODO Review: TCP/IP model

1. Why do we need another model besides the OSI model at all?
   #+begin_quote
   - OSI was theoretical while TCP/IP was developed on real world
     networking needs.
   - OSI only supports wired communication, TCP/IP adds wireless
     communication.
   - TCP/IP was developed and adopted alongside the internet while the
     OSI model remains a conceptual reference.
   #+end_quote

2. What are the four layers of TCP/IP?
   #+begin_quote
   1. *Network access:* Physical connection/data framing (MAC address).
   2. *Internet:* Packet addressing and routing (IP address)
   3. *Host-to-Host*: TCP and UDP protocols for data management.
   4. *Application*: HTTP, SMTP, FTP protocols and applications.
   #+end_quote

3. Remember one Linux command at each level of the TCP/IP model?
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
     arp -n # network: mapping IP to MAC addresses
     hostname -I # internet: IP address of your PC
     netstat -tul | head -n 10 # host-to-host: TCP and UDP connections
     wget -O ../src/init.el tinyurl.com/lyon-emacs
     file ../src/init.el
   #+end_src
