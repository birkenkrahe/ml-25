** DataCamp review: Cloud Computing - Deployment

1. Why is "cloud deployment" an issue and what is it?
   #+begin_quote
   The cloud computing environment can be hacked into.

   Deployment means choosing between a private, a public or a hybrid
   cloud.
   #+end_quote

2. How is Lyon's cloud computing environment deployed?
   #+begin_quote
   The infrastructure is hybrid:
   - Sensitive data (students, grades, personnel) are private
   - Some services are open to the public (Remote Desktop Service)
   #+end_quote

3. What's "cloud bursting"?
   #+begin_quote
   The private cloud is over capacity and resources are temporarily
   moved to the public cloud.
   #+end_quote

4. What's the GDPR? What does it say?
   #+begin_quote
   General Data Protection Regulation in countries of the European
   Union. A major pain in the butt for corporations. Very expensive.

   - Users must give explicit consent to data collection
   - Users must be notified of data breaches
   - Personal information must be anonymized and encrypted
   - Personal data cannot leave EU borders unless protected
   - Violations incur fine of up to 4% of worldwide annual revenue

   In the case of Amazon, that's $22 bn of $574 bn total, or $3 bn of
   the revenue of AWS ($90 bn).
   #+end_quote

5. What are considered "personal data"? Why are they protected?
   #+begin_quote
   - Home address
   - First and last name
   - Email address
   - Location data
   - IP address
   - Racial or ethnic origin
   - Political opinions
   - Sexual orientation
   - Health-related data

   Personal data can identify a person leading to potential identity
   theft with regard to any or all of the categories above.
   #+end_quote

** Review: TCP/IP model

1. Why do we need another model besides the OSI model at all?
   #+begin_quote
   - OSI was theoretical while TCP/IP was developed on real world
     networking needs.
   - OSI only supports wired communication, TCP/IP adds wireless
     communication.
   - TCP/IP was developed and adopted alongside the internet while the
     OSI model remains a conceptual reference.
   #+end_quote

2. What are the four layers of TCP/IP?
   #+begin_quote
   1. *Application*: HTTP, SMTP, FTP protocols and applications.
   2. *Host-to-Host*: TCP and UDP protocols for data management.
   3. *Internet:* Packet addressing and routing (IP address)
   4. *Network access:* Physical connection/data framing (MAC address).
   #+end_quote

3. Remember one Linux command at each level of the TCP/IP model?
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
     arp -n # network: mapping IP to MAC addresses
     hostname -I # internet: IP address of your PC
     netstat -tul | head -n 10 # host-to-host: TCP and UDP connections
     wget -O ../src/init.el tinyurl.com/lyon-emacs

* Week 4: IP addresses, subnets, domains
#+attr_html: :width 600px: 
[[../img/subnets.png]]

- [X] Missing tests? Complete this week for 50%
- [X] Review of *Data Encapsulation*
- [ ] Practice exercise: Python web server
- [ ] DataCamp review: Understanding cloud computing
- [ ] Continue with IP addresses and subnets
- [ ] Home assignment: Build a Cisco network

** DONE Review - Data Encapsulation

Check if you can answer these questions and attach a command-line
application, an image, or some other code to the relevant step.

1. What is data encapsulation in networking? Why is it important?
   #+begin_quote
   Data encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (e.g. text) with
   protocol-specific meta data (headers and footers) as it moves
   through the TCP/IP network stack.

   Data encapsulation allows modular communication, ensuring that
   higher layers (e.g., web applications) do not need to manage
   lower-level details (e.g., TCP, IP, Ethernet).
   #+end_quote
   #+attr_html: :width 200px:
   [[../img/ip_to_ethernet.png]]

2. Give a step by step data encapsulation breakdown for a web request
   by TCP/IP layer.
   #+begin_quote
   | *LAYER*             | *ENCAPSULATION*                                               |
   |-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Application Layer | A HTTP request is generated by the web browser              |
   | Transport Layer   | TCP segments add sequence numbers and reliability checks    |
   | Network Layer     | Segment is wrapped in an IP packet with destination address |
   | Data Link Layer   | Packet is encapsulated in Ethernet frame with MAC address   |
   | Physical Layer    | Frame is converted into signals for transmission            |
   #+end_quote

3. Why can't a web browser directly send an HTML file over the
   network?
   #+begin_quote
   The web browser cannot send an HTML file directly because the
   network requires structure communication protocols: 
   - HTML content must be included in a HTTP response
   - HTTP response must be encapsulated in a TCP segment
   - TCP segment must be wrapped inside an IP packet
   - IP packet must be placed in an Ethernet frame for transmission.
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_example
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Date: Fri, 17 Jan 2025 10:00:00 GMT
   Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
   Content-Length: 1234
   Connection: keep-alive
   Server: Apache/2.4.54 (Unix)
   #+end_example

4. What role does TCP play in the encapsulation process when
   transmitting a web page?
   #+begin_quote
   TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures that the HTTP response
   (which contains the HTML page) is reliably delivered. It segments
   large data into smaller chunks, ensures in-order delivery,
   retransmits lost packets, and manages congestion. The TCP segment
   is then passed down to the IP layer for addressing and routing.
   #+end_quote
   #+attr_html: :width 700px: 
   [[../img/socket.svg]]

5. How does a router handle an encapsulated HTTP response as it
   forwards it to the destination?
   #+begin_quote
   The router checks the IP packet's destination address and
   determines the nex best hop. It forwards the packet based on
   routing tables, strips the previous Ethernet frame and encapsulates
   the IP packet in a new frame for the next network segment.
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
   traceroute lyon.edu
   #+end_src

6. How can you observe real-time data encapsulation happening on your
   network? What is a condition to do this?
   #+begin_quote
   You can use tools like =tcpdump= or Wireshark (=tshark=) to capture
   packets in real-time. Running =sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -vv= allows you
   to see Ethernet frames, IP packets, and TCP segments, revealing the
   encapsulated layers as data moves through the network. 

   A condition to do this is that you have =sudo= rights because the
   information could easily be used to design an efficient network
   attack.
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
   ip link show
   nmcli device status
   # sudo tcpdump -i [device] -vv -X
   #+end_src



** DONE Review: Python web server

We're going to review the content first, and then we'll look at the
exercise again. 

1. What was the exercise about?
   #+begin_quote
   - Starting a web server, using it, shutting it down.
   - Exploring the =localhost= destination address.
   - Understanding how to use ports with web requests.
   - Finding stuff out by yourself instead of being told everything.
   #+end_quote
   
2. What exactly does a web server do?
   #+begin_quote
   The web server listens for incoming HTTP requests on a specific
   port and responds by serving files or handling requests. In this
   case, the Python HTTP server serves files from the specified
   directory to clients like web browsers.
   #+end_quote

3. What function does =curl= have?
   #+begin_quote
   The =curl= command is a /client/ of the server - it makes an HTTP
   request that the server fulfils.
   #+end_quote

4. What exactly is the port number?  
   #+begin_quote
   The port number is a specific communication endpoint on a computer
   that allows network services to operate. It helps direct internet
   traffic to the correct application. For example, in
   =http://localhost:8080=, port =8080= is where the web server listens
   for requests.
   #+end_quote

5. What were the implications of using a different port number?
   #+begin_quote
   Requests on a different port than the one specified when the server
   was started are not fulfilled. A new server that listens on that
   port must be started.
   #+end_quote

6. What are the implications of repeating the =python3= command?
   #+begin_quote
   You get an "address already in use" error. To use the same port,
   you have to shut the server down, or you must change the port.
   #+end_quote

7. Could this web server be used from outside of the computer?
   #+begin_quote
   By default, the Python HTTP server listens on =localhost=, meaning it
   can only be accessed from the same computer. However, if started
   with =python3 -m http.server 8080 --bind 0.0.0.0=, it would be
   accessible from other devices on the same network (now it is bound
   to the default gateway). To make it accessible over the internet,
   additional steps like firewall configuration and port forwarding
   would be needed.
   #+end_quote

8. How can the web server be shut down?
   #+begin_quote
   You can kill the terminal where it was started, or you can shut it
   down explicitly using the =PID=, the process number, which you get
   with =ps=. You can then =kill= the process. Or you can use =pkill= on
   (part of) the process name.
   #+end_quote

9. What is a daemon? What is an example?
   #+begin_quote
   A daemon is a service program that sits in the background listening
   to requests related to a persistent process. When a request is
   made, the daemon wakes the process. A daemon cannot be communicated
   with directly (except that it can be started, shut down, and asked
   for a status).

   An example is =systemd=, a daemon that initializes the system and
   manages other daemons.

10. Does the Python web server =http.server= have a daemon?
    #+begin_quote
    No it does not because it is not a persistent system service. It
    can be put in the background itself with =&= but it ends when the
    terminal session ends or when the process is killed.

** DONE Practice: Python web server

Download and complete: [[https://tinyurl.com/3-networks-practice-org][tinyurl.com/3-networks-practice-org]]

Upload your solution to Canvas before we discuss it.

1. Find out if your =localhost= is active.
2. Start a simple web server (=python3=) and retrieve data using (=curl=).
3. Find out which IP address corresponds to =localhost=.
4. Find out what happens if you change the port number
5. Change the directory information served by the server.
6. Shut down the web server(s).


** TODO Test 2 coming up (stuff from the last week)

- Remember that Test 1 will only be open until tonight!

** IN_PROGRESS Home assignment: Build a Cisco network

*How?* You need to install Cisco Packet Tracer on your PC unless you
want to have to come to the lab in Lyon 104. Ask for help if needed.

*Why?* This is a review of the short packet tracer demo from week 1, and
a preparation for looking at Cisco network switches, MAC address
tables, and the ARP protocol used to map IP addresses to a MAC
address.

*What?* Build the following network in Cisco Packet Tracer, test it and
upload the =.pkt= file to Canvas (Deadline: Monday 10 February, 11 am).

Demo: How to switch off automatic labeling and create notes.

#+attr_html: :width 400px: 
[[../img/pt_network.png]]

*Requires:*
1) Creating network hosts
2) Setting static IP addresses, subnet masks, MAC addresses
3) Testing the network with your own "hello world" HTML file
5) Saving the network configuration and upload to Canvas


** TODO DataCamp review: Cloud Providers and Case Studies

1. Which cloud provider has the largest market share as of the lesson?
   Do you still remember what this means in terms of revenue?

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the largest market share at 31%,
   followed by Microsoft Azure at 24% and Google Cloud at 11%.

   AWS revenue is $90 bn while Amazon's total revenue is $574 bn (15%)
   #+END_QUOTE

2. What is a key advantage of Microsoft Azure in the cloud market?

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Azure benefits from strong integration with Microsoft products
   (customer "lock-in"), making it a top-of-mind choice for
   enterprises already using Microsoft services (such as: MS Windows,
   MS Office, MS SQL server).
   #+END_QUOTE

3. What cloud service does Amazon SageMaker provide? How long would it
   take to learn how to use it (for someone new to ML)?

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Amazon SageMaker is a cloud machine learning platform that helps
   organizations streamline machine learning processes.

   ChatGPT breaks the training down and estimates 4-8 weeks for
   someone who is new to Machine Learning. Sounds like a summer job!
   #+END_QUOTE

4. Which Google Cloud service is specifically designed for data
   warehousing? How long would it take to learn?

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   BigQuery is Google Cloud's data warehousing service, designed for
   large-scale data analytics.

   ChatGPT estimates that a total beginner (no SQL, data warehousing
   or Google Cloud knowledge) needs 4-6 weeks to learn to use it.
   #+END_QUOTE

5. In the AWS case study, what improvement did NerdWallet experience
   after adopting Amazon SageMaker? What questions would you have?

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   NerdWallet used Amazon SageMaker to significantly reduce *training
   times* to days and cut *costs* by 75%, modernizing their data science
   practices.

   Important questions: What company is this? What's their business?
   How long did it take them? How long was the case study?
   #+END_QUOTE

6. What could be the case against cloud computing?

   #+begin_quote
   Chapters of the CIO article of the same title:
   - Migrating apps (cost, knowledge, skills)
   - Managing risk (loss of data, loss of control)
   - Meeting SLAs (Service Level Agreements)
   - TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)
