** DONE Review (Overview)

1. Remember at least 2 topics that will be addressed in this class.
   #+begin_quote
   1. Cloud computing
   2. Microservice technologies
   3. Networking and Internet protocols
   4. Cisco Packet Tracer simulation
   5. Socket programming with C
   #+end_quote

2. What is "Termux"?
   #+begin_quote
   A Linux emulator for Android phones.
   #+end_quote

3. Why is Linux relevant for computer networks?
   #+begin_quote
   1. Dominant operating system for servers (97% of web servers, 90%
      of cloud computing servers, > 70% of global market overall).
   2. Free and open source.
   3. Core platform for microservices like Docker and Kubernetes.
   4. Powerful command-line networking tools for configuration,
      firewalling, monitoring, analysis.
   #+end_quote

4. What is an Internet "packet"?
   #+begin_quote
   An Internet packet (= header + payload) is a small unit of data
   transmitted over a network as part of a message. Packets are
   independently routed through the network and then reassembled at
   their destination to recreate the original message.
   #+end_quote

5. What is Cisco Packet Tracer?
   #+begin_quote
   Cisco packet tracer is a cross-platform network simulation tool
   developed by Cisco Systems, the dominant firm in networking.
   #+end_quote

** TODO Review / Preview (next test sometime this week)

1. What is a network?
   #+begin_quote
   A collection of interconnected nodes or devices that exchange data.
   #+end_quote

2. Which areas of mathematics are most relevant for networks?
   #+begin_quote
   - *Graph theory* (theory of nodes connected by weighted edges) for
     network optimization and routing algorithms.
   - *Probability and statistics* for traffic modeling and performance
     analysis.
   - *Fourier analysis* (approximations of general functions by sums of
     simpler trigonometric functions) for signal processing.
   #+end_quote

3. In which sense it "The Internet is C" true?
   #+begin_quote
   - Network stacks (layered software supporting the network) is
     programmed in C.
   - All network-relevant (processes, files, sockets) kernel code is
     programmed in C.
   #+end_quote

4. Name at least two benefits of a "layering" approach to building:
   #+begin_quote
   - Modularity = independent design, development, maintenance
   - Abstraction = layer details hidden from other layers
   - Interchangeability = component replacement by layer
   - Interoperability = different systems working together
   #+end_quote

5. Name at least two of the layers of the OSI model.
   #+begin_quote
   1) Application
   2) Presentation
   3) Session
   4) Transport
   5) Network
   6) Data Link
   7) Physical
   #+end_quote

6. What does "on-premise" computing mean and what else is there?
   #+caption: Cloud service models - car analogy (DataCamp, 2020)
   #+attr_html: :width 600px
   [[../img/services.png]]

   #+begin_comment
    - On-premise: Run infrastructrure (servers), platform (apps), 
      and (end-customer) software.  

    - Cloud: Outsource infrastructure, platform(s), and software.
   #+end_comment

7. What do different cloud services (business models) deliver?
   #+caption: IaaS vs. PaaS vs. SaaS (DataCamp, 2020)
   #+attr_html: :width 600px
   [[../img/services1.png]]

8. What is the relationship between "control" and "abstraction" in
   cloud computing?
   #+caption: Control vs. Abstraction (DataCamp, 2020)
   #+attr_html: :width 500px
   [[../img/pyramid.png]]

9. Who dominates the cloud market?
   #+attr_html: :width 600px: 
   #+caption: Source: Synergy Research Group (not checked)
   [[../img/cloud_market.png]]

10. What is the size of the global IT services market?
    #+attr_html: :width 600px: 
    #+caption: Source: Precedence Research (not checked)
    [[../img/it_market.png]]

    #+begin_quote    
    The size of the market for cloud computing is 5.6% of the market
    for global IT services. 

    The rest (estimated via ChatGPT - not checked):
