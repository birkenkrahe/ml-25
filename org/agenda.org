#+caption: Salvador Dali, The Persistence of Memory (1931)
[[../img/cover.jpg]]

What inspired this painting by Dali? Is the answer a prediction? What
influences the prediction? Can the prediction be validated, and how?

#+begin_quote
- Yes, the answer to the question is a prediction informed by
  historical data. 

- It is influenced by Dali's own statements, historical context, such
  as cultural events at the time, and Dali's own experiences.

- The prediction can be partially validated but not proven.

- "The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of
  space and time [like in Einstein's theory of special relativity]."
  (Ad√©s)

- "The soft watches were inspired by the surrealist perception of a
  Camembert [cheese] melting in the sun." (Prigogine)

** TODO On DataCamp assignments

1. Watch the video first with full attention.
2. Write down immediate questions for later.
3. Build a notebook for DataCamp courses.
4. Recreate the individual steps in the video.
5. Create or import datasets.
6. Look up function definitions.
7. Solve the exercises outside of DataCamp.
8. If you loathe Emacs, use DataLab or Colab instead.
9. Don't ignore nagging questions that you have.
10. Start a journal to summarize what you've learnt.
