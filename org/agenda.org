* Week 1: Overview & Introduction
#+attr_html: :width 600px: 
#+caption: Salvador Dali, The Persistence of Memory (1931)
[[../img/cover.jpg]]

What inspired this painting by Dali? Is the answer a prediction? What
influences the prediction? Can the prediction be validated, and how?

#+begin_quote
- Yes, the answer to the question is a prediction informed by
  historical data.

- It is influenced by Dali's own statements, historical context, such
  as cultural events at the time, and Dali's own experiences.

- The prediction can be partially validated but not proven.

- "The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of
  space and time [like in Einstein's theory of special relativity]."
  (Ad√©s)

- "The soft watches were inspired by the surrealist perception of a
  Camembert [cheese] melting in the sun." (Prigogine)

** DONE On completing DataCamp assignments

1. Watch the video first with full attention.
2. Write down immediate questions for later.
3. Build a notebook for DataCamp courses.
4. Recreate the individual steps in the video.
5. Create or import datasets.
6. Look up function definitions.
7. Solve the exercises outside of DataCamp.
8. If you loathe Emacs, use DataLab or Colab instead.
9. Don't ignore nagging questions that you have.
10. Start a journal to summarize what you've learnt.


** NEXT Review

1. What is "Git"?
   #+begin_quote
   Git is version control software that supports the development and 
   #+end_quote

2. Which machine learning techniques will we not cover?
   #+begin_quote
   Machine learning techniques that use "black-box" models based on
   neural network architectures.
   #+end_quote

3. What is a "literate program"?
   #+begin_quote
   A program that is written primarily for humans, that includes
   documentation, code, and output, and that can be tangled into
   source code only, or woven into documentation only.
   #+end_quote

4. What is *confirmation bias*?
   #+begin_quote
   Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, and
   remember information in a way that *confirms* one's pre-existing
   beliefs or hypothesis (systematic assumptions) while giving less
   consideration to evidence that contradicts them.

   A colloquial term for confirmation bias is "tunnel vision".
   #+end_quote

5. Give an example for confirmation bias?
   #+begin_quote
   Someone who believes that climate change is a hoax might focus on
   cold weather as proof that global warming isn't real while ignoring
   historical evidence to the contrary.

   Conversely, someone who believes in climate change might
   overemphasize a single extreme weather event like a hurricane, as
   proof of climate change while ignoring that individual events
   usually have multiple factors.
   #+end_quote

6. *Let's discuss:* What is a good *response* to confirmation bias?
   #+begin_quote
   1. Actively look for information that challenges your beliefs.
   2. Engage in civilized debate with those who disagree with you.
   3. Ask neutral questions - not "Why" but "What" and "How".
   4. Rely on multiple sources created over a longer period of time.
   5. Challenge your own views through systematic self-reflection.
   6. Balance data-driven, mathematical, and heuristic methods.
   7. Make yourself more aware of the relative meaning of objectivity.
   8. Take time out from your hobby horses.
   9. Avoid social media like the plague.
   10. Eat and sleep well.
   #+end_quote

7. What's a "captcha"?
   #+begin_quote
   "Captcha" stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing" test to
   tell computers and humans apart. They range from media-based (e.g.
   text/image recognition) to behavior-based (e.g. motion patterns).
   #+end_quote

8. What's OCR?
   #+begin_quote
   Many old books and newspapers were digitized using Optical
   Character Recognition (OCR) software. When OCR struggled with
   certain words or symbols, von Ahn's reCaptcha presented users with
   two words: One that the software had difficulty recognizing, and
   one with a known answer. If their response to the known word was
   correct, then their response to the unknown word was used to
   improve the digitization process - an example of both
   "crowdsourcing" (as a human process) and labeling (as a machine
   learning step). Check out von Ahn's own explanation of "human
   computation" ([[https://youtu.be/PQ-xzwj_p_4?si=vD6-OoHcIwMWHnmh][BigThink, 2014]]) - shared in the group chat.

** TODO Testing and improving a classification model (lab)

- This is an example of a classroom exercise that you can use to get
  bonus points (which you may need to balance bad test results or
  missing assignments).

- If you missed class, or if you did not finish in class, you can
  submit this by the deadline. If you submit it after the deadline, or
  if you submit incomplete solutions, you lose points.
