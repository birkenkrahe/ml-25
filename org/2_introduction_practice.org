* Instructions

This exercise consists of four parts:
1. Testing the model on new patients (table)
2. Modifying the production rules (pseudocode)
3. Draw the new decision tree model (inline image)
5. Submit all deliverables as ZIP file to Canvas

** *Test the model on new patients*

Use the provided decision tree to classify the following
patients. Write the diagnosis based on the treeâ€™s production rules
as shown [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ml-25/blob/main/img/1_decision_tree.png][in this diagram]].

#+name: diagnostic_table
#+caption: Predictive diagnosis
| Patient | Swollen Glands | Fever | Diagnosis (using the model) |
|---------+----------------+-------+-----------------------------|
| 14      | Yes            | No    |                             |
| 15      | No             | No    |                             |
| 16      | No             | Yes   |                             |
| 17      | Yes            | Yes   |                             |

** Modify the production rules

Imagine you want to improve the decision tree by adding a new
attribute: *duration of symptoms* (short = less than 3 days, long =
more than 3 days). Update the production rules to incorporate this
new attribute. Duration of symptoms could for example lead to the
condition begin considered *acute* (short duration) or *chronic* (long
duration).

Original production rules:
#+begin_example
 IF swollen glands = YES
 THEN diagnosis = strep throat

 IF swollen glands = No & Fever = Yes
 THEN diagnosis = cold

 IF swollen glands = No & Fever = No
 THEN diagnosis = allergy
#+end_example

For example, if the glands are swollen and the duration of the
symptom is 3 days or more, then the diagnosis is chronic strep
throat.

Or if the patient has no fever and no swollen glands for fewer than
3 days then he is considered to have an acute allergy.

Updated production rules:
#+begin_example
...
#+end_example

** Draw the new decision tree model

*Draw* the new decision tree using =draw.io= or another free drawing
program. You can find the original production rules diagram here:
tinyurl.com/production-rule-diagnostic. Save it as a PNG file and
attach the solution here (using the =[[...]]= command for inline
Org-mode images):

#+attr_html: :width 600px:
[[../img/solution.png]]

** *Submission*

Submit this Org-mode file with the completed diagnostic table, with
the updated production rules, and with the updated diagram as a ZIP
file to Canvas.

Make sure that the ZIP file contains the =.org= file as well as the
=.png= file. To test this, you can open ZIP files in Emacs, see, open
and modify the content.

For example, my ZIP solution file [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ml-25/blob/main/img/submission.png][looks like this]].
