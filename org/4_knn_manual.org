* The Curse of Dimensionality

The fact that similarity (or distance) at higher dimensions loses its
discriminatory power is a fundamental mathematical property of higher
dimensional spaces: As dimensions grow, points tend to spread out and
the distances between them become uniform.

Let's demonstrate this in 2D and 3D for a few points only, and then
plot the respective distance functions for a larger sample.

* Setup
- Points:
  - A: Class 0
  - B: Class 1
  - C: Class 1
- Goal: Compare distances in 2D (low) and 3D (high) to illustrate the
  curse of dimensionality.
- Formula: \(\sqrt{(p_1 - q_1)^2 + (p_2 - q_2)^2 + \cdots + (p_n -
  q_n)^2}\)

* 2D Example
- Coordinates:
  - A = (0, 0)
  - B = (1, 1)
  - C = (2, 0)

** Distances
1. A to B:
   \(\sqrt{(0 - 1)^2 + (0 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 1} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\)
2. A to C:
   \(\sqrt{(0 - 2)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 0} = 2\)
3. B to C:
   \(\sqrt{(1 - 2)^2 + (1 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 1} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\)

** k-NN (k = 1) for P = (0.5, 0.5)
- A: \(\sqrt{(0.5 - 0)^2 + (0.5 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{0.5} \approx 0.707\)
- B: \(\sqrt{(0.5 - 1)^2 + (0.5 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{0.5} \approx 0.707\)
- C: \(\sqrt{(0.5 - 2)^2 + (0.5 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{2.5} \approx 1.581\)
- Nearest: Tie between A and B (0.707).

* 3D Example
- Coordinates:
  - A = (0, 0, 0)
  - B = (1, 1, 1)
  - C = (2, 0, 0.5)

** Distances
1. A to B:
   \(\sqrt{(0 - 1)^2 + (0 - 1)^2 + (0 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\)
2. A to C:
   \(\sqrt{(0 - 2)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0.5)^2} = \sqrt{4.25} \approx 2.061\)
3. B to C:
   \(\sqrt{(1 - 2)^2 + (1 - 0)^2 + (1 - 0.5)^2} = \sqrt{2.25} = 1.5\)

** k-NN (k = 1) for P = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
- A: \(\sqrt{(0.5 - 0)^2 + (0.5 - 0)^2 + (0.5 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{0.75}
  \approx 0.866\)
- B: \(\sqrt{(0.5 - 1)^2 + (0.5 - 1)^2 + (0.5 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{0.75}
  \approx 0.866\)
- C: \(\sqrt{(0.5 - 2)^2 + (0.5 - 0)^2 + (0.5 - 0.5)^2} = \sqrt{2.5}
  \approx 1.581\)
- Nearest: Tie between A and B (0.866).

* Observations
- *2D*: A-B = 1.414, A-C = 2 (difference = 0.586). Clear separation.
- *3D*: A-B = 1.732, A-C = 2.061 (difference = 0.329). Differences
  shrink.
- As dimensions increase, distances grow, but relative separation
  decreases, making k-NN less effective (curse of dimensionality).
