* Objectives

This course is concerned with algorithms that transform information
into actionable intelligence using present-day computers and big
data. We use R, a cross-platform, zero-cost statistical programming
environment that combines a wide range of functions, interfaces to
common machine learning packages, and best-in-class visualization.

* Student learning outcomes

Students who complete DSC 305, "Machine Learning" (ML), can:
- *Understand core machine learning concepts* including data
  exploration, classification, regression, and clustering techniques.
- *Apply machine learning algorithms* such as k-NN, Naive Bayes,
  decision trees, regression, neural networks, and support vector
  machines using R.
- *Evaluate and improve model performance* using appropriate metrics and
  strategies to optimize predictive accuracy.
- *Analyze real-world datasets* by implementing machine learning
  solutions to classification, regression, and clustering problems.
- *Interpret patterns and insights* from data through methods like
  market basket analysis and k-means clustering.
- *Manage and preprocess data* to ensure accuracy and relevance for
  machine learning models.
- Know how to effectively *present assignment and project results*

* Course requirements

- *Basic proficiency with R* is useful (as taught in DSC 105 or obtained
  independently on DataCamp "Introduction to R", GitHub's "fasteR", or
  Part I of Book of R by Davies, NoStarch 2016).
- Imagination, creativity and a visual mind, enjoying finding patterns
  and spotting correlations.
- Basic understanding of algorithms and data structures (in any
  programming language).
- Basic understanding of data science infrastructure especially
  literate programming methods.

* Grading system

You should be able to see your current grade at any time using the
Canvas gradebook for the course.

| WHEN    | DESCRIPTION            | IMPACT |
|---------+------------------------+--------|
| Weekly  | Assignments            |    25% |
| Weekly  | Multiple choice tests  |    25% |
| Monthly | Project Sprint Reviews |    25% |
| TBD     | Final exam (optional)  |    25% |

Notes:
- *To pass:* 60% of all available points.
- *Tests:* weekly online quizzes based on classroom lectures and
  practice.
- *Final exam:* random selection of the known test questions. *Note:* You
  only have to write the final exam if you want to improve your grade
  at the end of the course. If the final exam result is below your
  final grade average up to this point, it will be ignored.

* Grading table

This table is used to convert completion rates into letter
grades. for the midterm results, letter grades still carry signs,
while for the term results, only straight letters are given (by
rounding up).

|------------------+------------------|
| Percentage       | LETTER GRADE     |
|------------------+------------------|
| 100% to 89.5%    | A (very good)    |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 89.5% to 79.5% | B (good)         |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 79.5% to 69.5% | C (satisfactory) |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 69.5% to 59.5% | D (passed)       |
