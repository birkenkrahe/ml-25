* Networks

- A network is a system of connected nodes or network devices that
  exchange data (like files) and resources (like power).

- The simplest network:
  #+attr_html: :width 200px:
  #+Caption: Connecting two hosts (Bonaventure, 2021)
  [[../img/network.png]]

* The Internet is C

- Approximately *23 bn devices* are currently connected to the Internet:
  20 bn IoT (sensors), 3 bn computers & smartphones (though 85% or
  nearly 7 bn people own smartphones). These are very rough estimates.

- Almost every network stack (= software to connect to a network) is
  *programmed in C*, and all the network-relevant kernel code, including
  network-capable device drivers.

- Looking at C implementations alone would therefore unlock ALL
  networking secrets. But networking contains many different levels of
  *abstraction* (where the details of C are not helpful but hindering).

- *"The Internet is C"* is more true than to say "The Web is HTML"
  (which is what most people think): The Internet is based on C but
  the Web (a subset of the Internet) is build on a diverse tech stack.

* Layering structure = Divide and conquer

- Internet standards are called protocols: They define everything from
  voltage levels on an Ethernet cable to the compression factor of a
  JPG image on a web page.

- If you're programming an Internet router, you don't want to have to
  think of image compression for a web application, and vice
  versa. The structural answer: Divide and conquer (Caesar: /Divide et
  impera./) *Can you think of examples?* [fn:1]

- The basic structuring technique is *layering*: The whole problem is
  broken down in layers. Each layer provides services for the layer on
  top of it, and each upper layer relies on the layers underneath
  without needing to know how they work.

- *Can you think of an example for applied layering?*[fn:2]

- The conceptual benefits (example[fn:3]):
  1) *Modularity* (independent design, development and maintenance)
  2) *Abstraction* (layers don't need to know details elsewhere)
  3) *Interchangeability* (components can be replaced by layer)
  4) *Interoperability* (systems from different vendors work together)

* OSI Layer Model

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is from 1977, published
as [[https://www.iso.org/standard/20269.html][ISO 7498]] ([[https://cdn.standards.iteh.ai/samples/20269/4b12bcad0c6247dba2875b7cdf47b807/ISO-IEC-7498-1-1994.pdf][PDF sample]]). It's worth looking at this document.
#+attr_html: :width 200px:
#+caption: OSI Layer Model
[[../img/osi.png]]

Let's briefly look at each layer[fn:4]

1. *Physical Layer:* Physical communication in the real world.
   - Voltage levels on an Ethernet cable
   - What each pin on a connector is for
   - Radio frequency of Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)
   - Light flashes over an optic fiber

2. *Data Link*: Protocols connecting two network nodes[fn:5].
   - How a direct message between nodes starts and ends (framing)
   - How messaging errors are detected and corrected
   - How message flow is controlled (e.g. based on MAC address)

3. *Network Layer*: Methods to transmit packets between nodes in
   different networks.
   - Layer for the Internet protocol (IP)
   - Example for a command: =ping lyon.edu=
   - Determines best path for data transmission (datagram)
   - Routers maintain routing and forwarding tables
   - Diagrams show network topology (connectivity abstraction)
     #+attr_html: :width 400px:
     #+caption: A simple network with two hosts and four routers
     [[../img/topology.png]]
   - Networks are modeled as directed weighted graphs[fn:6]

4. *Transport Layer:* Methods to deliver variable length data between
   hosts.
   - Layer for the TCP (Transfer Communication Protocol)
   - Splitting data up and recombine it
   - Ensuring data arrives in order and without errors

5. *Session Layer*: Manages dialogs between applications.
   - Establish, maintain, terminate a connection
   - A video conference session
   - A SSH (Secure Shell, remote login) session
   - Checkpoint (handshake), suspend (pause), resume dialogs

6. *Presentation Layer:* Manage data translation to applications.
   - Data encoding, compression and encryption
   - Converting image files so that an app can open (PNG, JPG, GIF)
   - Data compression in video streaming

7. *Application Layer:* User applications
   - Web browser using HTTP to load a web page
   - Email client using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
   - FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for transferring files between PCs

* OSI Application: Web browser

- An application like a web browser, exists in the application layer.

- The HTTP used to transmit web pages (https://github.com/birkenkrahe)
  does not care HOW the data is transmitted.
  #+attr_html: :width 400px:
  #+caption: Abstracted (visible) vs. actual (hidden) connection
  [[../img/browser.png]]

* Frames, packets, segments, and datagrams

Data chunks have different names depending on the OSI layer:
- A data unit on layer 2 (data link) is called a *frame*
- A data unit on layer 3 (network) is called a *packet*
- A data unit on layer 4 (transport) is called a *segment* if it is
  part of a TCP connection, but a *datagram* if it's a UDP message

* TCP/IP Layer Model

- TCP/IP model is the most common network communication model in
  use. The same functions are performed in both models with different
  divisions.

  #+attr_html: :width 400px:
  #+caption: OSI and TCP/IP layer models
  [[../img/tcpip.png]]

- The OSI model is used to reason and understand networking concerns
  but the TCP/IP model reflects the real network implementation
  better.

- Its layers are as follows:

  1. *Network Access Layer:* Physical host connection and data framing,
     like sending an Ethernet or Wi-Fi packet over the network. This
     is where the (hardwired) MAC address is used:

     - Example: Mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses
       #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
         arp -n
       #+end_src

     - Result at my house:
       #+begin_example sh
       : Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
       : 192.168.68.53            ether   78:80:38:cc:71:88   C                     wlo1
       : 192.168.68.57            ether   ae:4b:fd:96:38:90   C                     wlo1
       : 192.168.68.1             ether   60:83:e7:71:ed:50   C                     wlo1
       : 192.168.1.254            ether   6c:4b:b4:6f:65:21   C                     enp4s0
       #+end_example

  2. *Internet Layer*: Addressing packets and routing them over multiple
     interconnected networks. This is where an IP address is defined:

     ExamppeL: Display host name(s) as IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6):
     #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
       hostname -I | cut -d' ' -f1  # use ' ' delimiter, first field only
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 192.168.1.250

  3. *Host-to-Host Layer:* Provides two protocols, TCP (Transfer
     Communication Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for data
     order, data segmentation, network congestion, error correction.

     - Example: Show active TCP and UDP connections and listening ports:
       #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
         netstat -tul | head -n 10
       #+end_src

     - Results at my house:
       #+begin_example
       Active Internet connections (only servers)
       Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
       tcp        0      0 localhost:domain        0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
       tcp        0      0 localhost:ipp           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
       tcp6       0      0 localhost:ipp           [::]:*                  LISTEN
       tcp6       0      0 [::]:60000              [::]:*                  LISTEN
       tcp6       0      0 [::]:1716               [::]:*                  LISTEN
       udp        0      0 localhost:domain        0.0.0.0:*
       udp        0      0 localhost:323           0.0.0.0:*
       udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:33442           0.0.0.0:*
       #+end_example

  4. *Process/Application Layer:* Implements protocols such as HTTP,
     SMTP, FTP, Telnet, =wget=. Socket programming happens here making
     use of Linux' implementation of the lower layers.

     - Example: Get URL from web & store in =.emacs= configuration file
       #+begin_example sh
       wget -O .emacs tinyurl.com/lyon-emacs
       #+end_example

     - Example: resolve network domain names:
       #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
         nslookup lyon.edu
       #+end_src

     - Answer:
       #+begin_example
       : Server:        127.0.0.53
       : Address: 127.0.0.53#53
       :
       : Non-authoritative answer:
       : Name:    lyon.edu
       : Address: 40.119.1.254
       #+end_example

* Data encapsulation

- Lower-levels handle data from higher levels: their data structures
  must encapsulate data from higher levels.

- Example: A web browser only implements the protocols dealing with
  websites - HTTP, HTML, CSS, etc. It doesn't need to bother with
  TCP/IP or Wi-Fi.

- A web server, *Host A*, transmits a web page to the receiver, *Host B*:
  #+attr_html: :width 400px:
  #+caption: Host A sends web page to Host B
  [[../img/web_server.png]]

- The journey of the data up and down the layers looks like this:

  1. Text is encoded in an HTML structure before it can be sent:
     #+attr_html: :width 200px:
     [[../img/text_to_html.png]]

     - The text:
       #+begin_example
       * Welcome to My HTML Page

       This is a simple HTML page in Org-mode format.
       #+end_example

     - The HTML encoding:
       #+begin_example html
       <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html lang="en">
       <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <meta name="author" content="Marcus Birkenkrahe">
         <meta name="description" content="A simple HTML starter page">
         <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, Org-mode, Example">
         <title>Example HTML Page</title>
       </head>
       <body>
         <h1>Welcome to My HTML Page</h1>
         <p>This is a simple HTML page in Org-mode format.</p>
       </body>
       #+end_example

     - This is essentially what Emacs does when you dynamically
       (on-the-fly) render an Org-mode page with =C-c C-e h o=
       ("Org-mode dispatch as HTML open file").

  2. The HTML file cannot be send as such either! It must be
     transmitted as part of a HTTP response.
     #+attr_html: :width 200px:
     [[../img/html_to_http.png]]

     - The web server does this by applying the appropriate HTTP
       header to the HTML:
       #+begin_example
       HTTP/1.1 200 OK
       Date: Fri, 17 Jan 2025 10:00:00 GMT
       Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
       Content-Length: 1234
       Connection: keep-alive
       Server: Apache/2.4.54 (Unix)
       #+end_example

  3. The HTTP response is transmitted as part of a TCP session. This
     is taken care of by the operating system's TCP/IP stack:
     #+attr_html: :width 200px:
     [[../img/http_to_tcp.png]]

     This (still untested) Python program defines HTML content and
     HTTP header, and creates a TCP socket (to localhost) to access
     the server in your browser at http://localhost:8080:

     1. =html_content= contains the HTML file
     2. =http_response= includes HTTL header and HTML content
     3. A TCP/IP socket is created and bound to =localhost:8080=
     4. The server listens for incoming connections.
     5. The server accepts connections, reads the request, and sends
        the HTTP response.

        #+begin_src python :python python3 :session *Python* :tangle socket.py
          import socket

          # HTML content to be served
          html_content = """
          <!DOCTYPE html>
          <html>
          <head>
              <title>Simple HTML File</title>
          </head>
          <body>
              <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
              <p>This is a simple HTML file served via a basic HTTP server.</p>
          </body>
          </html>
          """

          # HTTP response
          http_response = f"""\
          HTTP/1.1 200 OK
          Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
          Content-Length: {len(html_content)}

          {html_content}
          """

          # Create a TCP socket
          server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
          server_socket.bind(("localhost", 8080))  # Bind to localhost and port 8080
          server_socket.listen(1)  # Listen for incoming connections

          print("Server is running at http://localhost:8080")
          try:
              while True:
                  # Accept an incoming connection
                  client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
                  print(f"Connection received from {client_address}")

                  # Read the request (not parsed here for simplicity)
                  request = client_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
                  print(f"Request:\n{request}\n")

                  # Send the HTTP response
                  client_socket.sendall(http_response.encode('utf-8'))

                  # Close the connection
                  client_socket.close()
          except KeyboardInterrupt:
              print("Shutting down the server...")
          finally:
              server_socket.close()
        #+end_src

  4. The TCP packet is routed by an IP packet.
     #+attr_html: :width 200px:
     [[../img/tcp_to_ip.png]]

     - The =traceroute= command prints the trace to the network host -
       it assumes a maximum of 30 "hops" between routers until it
       reaches the destination
       #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
         traceroute lyon.edu
       #+end_src

     - This is what I get at home:
       #+begin_example bash
       traceroute to lyon.edu (40.119.1.254), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
       1  dsldevice.attlocal.net (192.168.1.254)  0.976 ms  1.242 ms  1.473 ms
       2  69.234.156.1 (69.234.156.1)  6.150 ms  6.160 ms  6.171 ms
       3  71.154.103.130 (71.154.103.130)  12.077 ms  12.090 ms  21.021 ms
       4  32.130.17.194 (32.130.17.194)  21.008 ms  21.022 ms  21.035 ms
       5  32.130.17.39 (32.130.17.39)  21.087 ms  21.043 ms  21.122 ms
       6  * * 12.90.152.70 (12.90.152.70)  24.274 ms
       7  ae21-0.icr03.sn6.ntwk.msn.net (104.44.230.116)  31.217 ms  31.202 ms ae32-0.icr01.sn6.ntwk.msn.net (104.44.230.112)  29.308 ms
       ...
       #+end_example

     - How many hops to get to yourself as the host? (=localhost=)
       #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
         traceroute localhost
       #+end_src

     - On my machine:
       #+begin_example
       : traceroute to localhost (127.0.0.1), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
       :  1  localhost (127.0.0.1)  0.010 ms  0.001 ms  0.001 ms
       #+end_example

  5. The IP packet is transmitted over the wire in an Ethernet frame. 
     #+attr_html: :width 200px:
     [[../img/ip_to_ethernet.png]]

     - The =tcpdump= command shows a hexadecimal representation of the
       full packet including Ethernet headers.

     - First you have to find out what your ethernet link is called:
       #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
       ip link show
       #+end_src

     - On my machine it's not =eth0= but =enp4s0=
       #+begin_example
       : 1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
       :     link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
       : 2: enp4s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
       :     link/ether 74:56:3c:b9:74:2d brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
       : 3: wlo1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DORMANT group default qlen 1000
       :     link/ether 28:c5:d2:33:f1:c6 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
       :     altname wlp0s20f3
       #+end_example

     - Or you can use =nmcli= (Network Manager Command Line Interface):
       #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
       nmcli device status
       #+end_src

       #+RESULTS:
       : DEVICE        TYPE      STATE         CONNECTION         
       : enp4s0        ethernet  connected     Wired connection 1 
       : wlo1          wifi      connected     deco2024           
       : p2p-dev-wlo1  wifi-p2p  disconnected  --                 
       : lo            loopback  unmanaged     --                 
       
     - On my machine:
       #+begin_example
       DEVICE        TYPE      STATE         CONNECTION         
       enp4s0        ethernet  connected     Wired connection 1 
       wlo1          wifi      connected     deco2024           
       p2p-dev-wlo1  wifi-p2p  disconnected  --                 
       lo            loopback  unmanaged     --                 
       #+end_example
       
     - Dump the frame:
       #+begin_example bash
       sudo tcpdump -i enp4s0 -vv -X
       #+end_example

       The result shows individual packets. It begins like this:
       #+begin_example sh
       tcpdump: listening on enp4s0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), 
       snapshot length 262144 bytes

* Internet Protocol

- One "protocol" (set of rules to facilitate network traffic) is
  overwhelmingly common today: IP. It comes in two versions, IPv4 and
  IPv6. IPv4 is ubiquitous, and IPv6 is growing.

- IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses or max. 2^32 uniquely identifiable
  systems:
  #+begin_src R
    2^32
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 4294967296

- These 4.3 bn addresses were not initially assigned efficiently
  (nobody knew how much this show would grow!) and providers today
  are forced to ration IPv4 addresses.

- IPv6 was designed 1998 to replace IPv4. It uses a 128-bit address,
  or theoretically 2^128 addresses for uniquely identifiable systems:
  #+begin_src R
    2^128
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 3.40282366920938e+38

- That is about 10^14 times larger than the number of stars in the
  observable universe, and 10^16 times larger than the estimated
  number of grains of sand on Earth's beaches.

- Every desktop and smartphone OS supports both IPv4 and IPv6
  (so-called dual-stack configuration). 

* IN_PROGRESS What is an address? IPv4 vs. IPv6

- All Internet Protocol (IP) traffic routes to an address - like phone
  calls that must be dialed to phone numbers.

- IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long. They are divided into four 8-bit (1
  byte word) sections. Each section is displayed as a decimal number
  between 0 and 255 and delineated by a period.

- Examples
  #+begin_example
  0.0.0.0
  127.0.0.1
  10.0.0.0
  172.16.0.5
  192.168.0.1
  192.168.50.1
  255.255.255.255
  #+end_example

- A special address, the *loopback address*, is reserved at
  =127.0.0.1=. To the computer, it means "establish a connection to
  myself".

- You can see this in the file =/etc/hosts/=, or by tracing the path
  with =traceroute=, or by entering =ping 127.0.0.1=, or by opening
  =127.0.0.1= in your browser (this may not work).

[fn:1] Divide and conquer in other areas: Fourier transform (signal
processing), sorting algorithms (binary sort), mob control (break mob
up in parts).

[fn:2] Layers in building construction: Foundation, building skeleton
(frame), utilities (plumbing, electrics, HVAC), finish (walls,
flooring, paint).

[fn:3] In house building, modularity = interior & exterior design;
abstraction = wall paint is independent of electric circuitry;
interchangeability = replace plumbing without changing foundation;
interoperability = choose freely which lamp to plug in.

[fn:4] For much more detail, see Bonaventure, [[https://beta.computer-networking.info/syllabus/default/principles/reliability.html#][Connecting two hosts
together]] - in his interactive ebook (2021).

[fn:5] Sample question on this layer: "Consider two hosts connected by
a physical cable. The two hosts are separated by a distance of 830
kilometers and the propagation delay is 5 microseconds per
kilometer. What is the delay required to send one bit from the sender
to the receiver (in milliseconds)?" (Source: Bonaventure, 2021).

[fn:6]A directed weighted graph can for example model a road network:
vertices = cities, edges = roads connecting cities, weights =
distances.
